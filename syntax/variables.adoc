== Variables

It is often useful to store the result of some link:./basic-expressions.adoc[expression] or call to a link:./functions.adoc[function]. We do this by storing the value in the computers _random access memory_ (RAM).

When we store a value in the memory, it has to go at some _address_ (or _location_). We don't have to remember the address ourselves, however, since we can give it a _name_ (or _identifier_).

For example:

[source,javascript]
----
let givenName = "Ada";
let familyName = "Lovelace";
let fullName = givenName + " " + familyName;
console.log(fullName); // prints "Ada Lovelace" to the console <1>
----
1. Ada Lovelace was the first programmer. She was born over 200 years ago!
