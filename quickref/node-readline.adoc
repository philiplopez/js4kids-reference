== Text Input (Node.js)

Node.js doesn't have an _easy_ way to read input from the command line, so we have to use a Node.js link:./node-packages.adoc[package].

The package to use is called `readline-sync` so install it using the command-line in your JavaScript program directory:

[source,bash]
----
npm install readline-sync
----

Now you can use the https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync[various functions] such as the following:

* question - gets the text string typed into the terminal
* questionInt - waits until an integer (whole number) is typed into the terminal

and many others.


The simplest usage is as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
// load the package (npm install first!)
const r = require('readline-sync');

const name = r.question("Your name? ");
const age = r.questionInt("Your age? ");

console.log("You are", name);
console.log("You are", age, "years old");
