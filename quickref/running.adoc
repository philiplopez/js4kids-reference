== Running JavaScript code

JavaScript is a programming language that needs to be _interpreted_ by some other computer program (the "JavaScript engine").

You typically run JavaScript either:

* in a web browser (such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer) 
* at the command-line using Node.js

=== Command-line
You need https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js]
to be installed to run JavaScript from the command-line (terminal).

At the prompt, you run node and give it the path to a file, as follows:
[source,bash]
----
node hello.js
----

=== Web browser
* TODO - Link to browser console
* TODO - Link to browser HTML...
