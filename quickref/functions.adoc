== Functions

Functions are like little _machines_ that take in one or more inputs, and produce some output. They can also have _side-effects_, which cause changes to the running JavaScript program or even do something outside it (like draw or print text on the screen, or play a sound).


=== Calling a Function

[source,javascript]
----
// console.log(....) only has side-effects
// it prints out the inputs to the console
console.log("A", "B", "C"); // three inputs

// Math.min(...) returns the lowest number
const minimum = Math.min(3, 8, 4, 19, 2);
// minimum = 2
----


== Defining a Function

JavaScript has a number of different ways to define (make) a function.
