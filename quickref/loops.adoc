== Loops for Repetition

Computers excel at doing simple things many, many times (without getting bored!). Loops are often used to:

* process collections of data (such as an array)
* wait until some event occurs


=== The for loop

If you know how many times you need to do something, you should use a `for` loop. This is particularly useful for arrays.

The first `for` loop syntax in JavaScript is based on the very old (1972!) syntax from the C programming language.

An example:

[source,javascript]
----
// an array of balloon colours
const colours = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple"];

for (let i = 0; i < colours.length; i++) {
    const balloonColour = colours[i];
    console.log(baloonColour);
}
// will print out:
// red
// green
// blue
// yellow
// purple

==== Modern JavaScript: the for...of loop

=== The while loop

TODO: explanation

[source,javascript]
----
let counter = 0;
while (counter < 5) {
    console.log(counter);
    counter = counter + 1;
}
// will print out: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
