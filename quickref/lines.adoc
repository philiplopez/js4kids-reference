== Lines and semi-colons

In JavaScript, you can end a _statement_ with a semi-colon, or without one. If you don't put in a semi-colon, the JavaScript engine will _automatically insert_ them for you. It usually puts them in where you expect, but it may not! So, as a beginner, use semi-colons!

[source,javascript]
----
// semi-colon at end
console.log("Hello");

// no semi-colon at end
console.log("Hello")

// Two lines of "Hello" will print out
----

Statements can be spread over multiple lines, but this can lead to bugs if the JavaScript can be interpreted in different ways.
