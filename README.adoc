# JavaScript for Kids - Reference

Learning a programming language can be hard. To start, you need to know:

* how to actually create and run code

* _syntax_, which is the set of rules for writing a valid program

* how to use the _built-in functions_ in the language to do common tasks such as input and output, manipulate text, basic math, and so on.

* how to install and use other _libraries_ of functions to simplify your own programs.
