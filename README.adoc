# JavaScript for Kids - Reference

Learning a programming language can be hard. To start, you need to know:

* how to actually create and run code

* _syntax_, which is the set of rules for writing a valid program

* how to use the _built-in functions_ in the language to do common tasks such as input and output, manipulate text, basic math, and so on.

* how to install and use other _libraries_ of functions to simplify your own programs.


This is not a JavaScript _course_ but intended to be a reference while you are learning (and starting to use) JavaScript. It is targeted toward younger learners (not too much to read!) but can be used by anyone who is new to programming.
